All RPN calculations are done in a stack, which holds all the numbers
that are currently being used. For more information on RPN, visit the
Wikipedia page: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_Notation
!rpn -> displays the number currently at the top of the stack
!rpn 2 -> displays "2" and adds it to the stack
!rpn 2 + -> adds 2 to the number currently at the top of the stack
!rpn 3 2 + -> displays "5" and adds it to the stack
!rpn 3 6 * 2 + -> displays "20" and adds it to the stack
!rpn 6 9 8 * 2 3 + - + / -> divides the number currently at the top of the stack by 74
