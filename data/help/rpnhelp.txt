Syntax: !rpn <number | operator | reset>*
Currently allowed operators: + - * / mod sqrt AC C
Typing in "reset" or "AC" anywhere will clear the stack. Typing in "cancel", "C", or "CE" will clear the last number off the top of the stack.
Typing in a command with a number at the end will display that number at the end of the stack after performing all the requested operations.
Typing in a blank !rpn command will display the number currently at the top.
If there is an error, the computation as input will immediately cease and the number at the top of the stack will be returned.
For example inputs, type !dragobot rpnexample.
