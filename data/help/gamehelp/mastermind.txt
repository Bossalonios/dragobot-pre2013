In order to enter a guess, simply type any 4-digit number (no triggers necessary).
When a guess is entered, the following will pop up:
[Example] 1. 1234  1A2B  Score: 200 (+200)
The "xAxB" number gives you a clue as to what the number is.
The number before "A" tells you how many digits in your guess are in the secret number, in the same position.
The number before "B" tells you how many digits in your guess are in the secret number, but in a different position.
